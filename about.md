# Hierarchical Resource Allocation System - Requirements Specification Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the comprehensive requirements for a Hierarchical Resource Allocation System - a multi-tenant web application designed to enable organizations to distribute and manage resources across multiple organizational levels with manual reallocation capabilities. The system supports various resource types including financial budgets, sales targets, procurement quotas, and other quantifiable organizational resources.

### 1.2 Scope

The system enables organizations to create hierarchical allocation structures where resources can be distributed from a central level down through multiple sub-levels (e.g., national → state → district → local). When lower-level units underperform against targets, authorized personnel can manually reallocate those resources to better-performing units within the same hierarchical level, subject to approval workflows.

### 1.3 Requirements Overview

The system encompasses 28 core requirements across multiple categories, with critical functionality focused on hierarchical management, manual reallocation processes, and multi-tenant architecture.

## 7. Conclusion

This requirements specification defines a comprehensive hierarchical resource allocation system with manual reallocation capabilities. The 28 core requirements span critical functional areas including hierarchy management, performance monitoring, approval workflows, and multi-tenant architecture, supported by robust non-functional requirements for security, performance, and compliance.

The manual reallocation workflow represents the key enhancement, enabling organizations to dynamically redistribute resources from underperforming units to high-performing alternatives while maintaining proper governance through configurable approval hierarchies. This capability transforms static allocation systems into responsive organizational tools that adapt to changing performance conditions while preserving accountability and audit requirements.
